# Confetti

Library of M4L devices based on the modules in [The Party Van](http://rodrigoconstanzo.com/the-party-van/), [Cut Glove](http://rodrigoconstanzo.com/cut-glove/), and [TPV2](https://github.com/rconstanzo/tpv2).

I will slowly add more modules to this as I go through and convert them, generally with some refactoring/improvements, and better commenting/documentation.

## Requirements

Live/M4L or Max (Mac/Windows).

## Documentation

Additional documentation/videos forthcoming.
Cloud uses the [HIRT](https://cycling74.com/articles/package-arrival-the-hisstools-impulse-response-toolbox) and [FluCoMa](http://www.flucoma.org) libraries (all dependencies are built into M4L device, so no need to download anything).
